<h1>Project Description:</h1>
The goal of this project is to develop a console application in Java that allows users to manage a to-do list. The application should enable users to add, delete, list, and mark tasks (CRUD) as completed. The development will be done without the use of object-oriented programming principles, meaning no classes or objects will be used. All logic will be handled using primitive data structures and functions.
<h1>Project Objectives:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Understand the basic concepts of data input and output, and programming concepts in Java.</li>
<li>Implement logic using appropriate formulas.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Project Requirements:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge of Java programming, including variables, arithmetic operators, control structures, and loops.</li>
<li>Familiarity with input and output in the Java console.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Functional Requirements:</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Add Task:</b> The user should be able to add a new task to the list. The task will be represented as a text string.</li>
<li><b>Delete Task:</b> The user should be able to delete an existing task from the list by specifying its index.</li>
<li><b>List Tasks:</b> The user should be able to see a list of all tasks, indicating which ones are completed and which are not.</li>
<li><b>Mark Task as Completed:</b> The user should be able to mark a specific task as completed by specifying its index.</li>
<li><b>Exit:</b> The user should be able to exit the application.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Technical Requirements:</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Input and Output:</li> The application should interact with the user through the console. User inputs will be read using Scanner and outputs will be displayed with System.out.println.</li>
<li><b>Task Storage:</li> Tasks and their completion status will be stored in two parallel arrays. One array for task descriptions and another array of boolean values for task statuses.</li>
<li><b>Functions:</li> The program logic will be structured into functions, each responsible for a specific functionality (add task, delete task, etc.).<l
<li><b>Flow Control:</li> Use control structures like for and while loops, and if-else conditionals to handle the application's logic.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Evaluation Methods:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Team Work, in teams of 4 people.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Expected Deliverables:</h1>
<ul>
<li>GitHub repository with the corresponding README</li>
<li>Kanban board (in Jira, Trello, or the tool the team considers optimal)</li>
</ul>
